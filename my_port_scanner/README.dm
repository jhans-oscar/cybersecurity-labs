# My Port Scanner

A hands-on learning project for improving programming skills in the cybersecurity domain. This repository documents progressive implementations of a port scanner and related utilities, demonstrating increasing complexity and techniques.

## Goals
- Learn network scanning fundamentals (TCP/UDP, SYN/Connect scans).
- Practice secure, maintainable code and testing.
- Document progress and design decisions for future reference.

## Features
- Incremental implementations showing different scanning approaches.
- Clear project structure.

## Project structure
- README.md â€” project overview and usage
- requirements.txt - project requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- scanner.py - project 

## Getting started
1. Install required runtime and dependencies (see src/ or requirements file).

## Usage
- Always obtain explicit permission before scanning networks you do not own.

## Security & Ethics
This project is for educational purposes. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal or harmful. Use only on networks where permission has been granted.

## Contributing
Contributions that improve clarity, add tests, or introduce new scanning techniques are welcome. Open an issue or a pull request with a clear description and tests where applicable.

## Contact
For questions or suggestions, open an issue in this repository.
