# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

## **1st January 20XX**

## ---

# **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# **Purpose**

The database server is a critical asset that stores and manages sensitive business information required for daily operations. Securing this system is essential to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company data, including financial records, customer details, and internal communications. A compromise of the server could expose sensitive data, disrupt business processes, or damage the organizationâ€™s reputation. This vulnerability assessment is conducted to evaluate risks, prioritize threats, and recommend safeguards aligned with organizational objectives and regulatory requirements.

# **Risk Assessment**

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *E.g. Competitor* | *Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration* | *1* | *3* | *3* |
| *Malicious outsider (hacker)* | *Exploits weak authentication to gain unauthorized access to the database* | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| *Insider (employee/contractor)* | *Misuses legitimate access to steal or leak sensitive business data* | *2* | *3* | *6*  |
| *System failure (hardware/software)* | *Database server crash causing downtime and data unavailability* | *2* | *2* | *4* |

# **Approach**

Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks to day-to-day operational needs.

- **Likelihood 3, Severity 3** for external attackers: databases are prime targets, and compromise would be catastrophic.  
- **Likelihood 2, Severity 3** for insider threat: less frequent, but impact is very high.

- **Likelihood 2, Severity 2** for system failure: redundancy usually reduces severity, but business disruption is still notable.

# **Remediation Strategy**

To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should implement a layered security strategy focused on access control, encryption, and system resilience. Strong authentication and role-based access controls, combined with multi-factor authentication, will limit unauthorized access and reduce the risk of insider misuse. All sensitive data should be encrypted in transit using modern protocols such as TLS 1.2 or higher, replacing legacy SSL. Network restrictions, such as IP allow-listing, will further reduce the attack surface. Finally, continuous monitoring, audit logging, and resilient backup procedures will ensure timely detection, response, and recovery from security incidents.
